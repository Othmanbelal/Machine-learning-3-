Your goal is to construct a neural network from the ground up and we will show how to apply it to a reinforcement learning problem. This endeavor aims to lay a solid foundation for your comprehension of neural networks and the inherent challenges they pose. This may well be one of the very few opportunities you'll have to create such a network from scratch, granting you insight into what transpires behind the scenes. Following this, you'll likely rely on libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow, which abstract much of the mathematics. \n",

    "In reinforcement learning, the primary aim is to maximize future rewards. While this may not seem significantly different from supervised learning, the implications are profound. Consider the scenario where you want an AI to navigate a maze: at each time step, the AI can make a move in any valid direction. If you were to approach this as a regression problem, akin to supervised learning, you would need to know the precise solution for every step, which becomes infeasible for complex problems. Reinforcement learning simplifies the human side of the problem by using rewards. For instance, you can reward the AI only when it successfully solves the maze and allow the AI to explore freely. You don't instruct it on how to solve the maze directly but instead provide a reward for completing the task. The AI will then determine the most effective way to maximize the reward over the entire episode. \n",

When the actor successfully completes a task or makes a correct move, a reward $r$ is given. Conversely, penalties can be imposed for suboptimal or incorrect actions. These rewards and penalties serve as the means to influence and shape what the algorithm attempts to learn and optimize.

    "## Training Deep Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for this section is that we will walk you through the code and the process and then you will answer some theoretical questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a neural network, and we aim to employ it to balance an inverted pendulum on a cart. This problem involves continuous input space, with four inputs, and a discrete output space, consisting of two possible actions (left or right). The reward function for this task is straightforward - we receive a reward for every step taken, with the objective being to maintain balance. The task is considered unsuccessful if the pendulum leans too far or the cart moves excessively to the side. You can find more details about this problem at https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with this problem is that the continuous input space makes it impractical to use standard Q-learning, as the Q-table would become excessively large. To address this, we'll replace the Q-table with a neural network. However, as we will demonstrate, this transition is not without its challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge in deep Q-learning lies in training stability, as the training process tends to be noisy, and many issues can arise. To enhance stability, we introduce three key components: target networks, experience replay, and batch gradient descent. However, before delving into those specifics, let's discuss the fundamental principle of replacing the Q-table with a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q-learning, we maintain a table of future expected rewards, and for a given state and action, we can obtain the value, denoted as $Q(s, a)$. Our objective is to approximate this Q-value using a neural network, denoted as $f$, which takes the state as input and produces a value for each possible action, i.e., $\\hat{q} = f(s)$, where $\\hat{q}$ is a vector. The training loop remains similar to traditional Q-learning, but in this case, we formulate a loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{L}(s_t, a) = (q(s_t)_a -\\hat{q}(s_t)_a)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "were \n",
    "\n",
    "$q(s_t)_a = r + \\gamma \\underbrace{\\max}_{a} \\hat{q}(s_{t+1})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and $\\hat{q}(s_t)_a$ is the output of the network for that action and state, and $\\hat{q}(s_{t+1})$ is for the next state. This will make the network converge towarde the Q-table, atleast theoretically. The problem is that this is prone to instabilities. We can no longer initiate the network to predict zeros initially, so the initial predictions of the future reward will be completely wrong. Every time we update the weights we will also change $\\underbrace{\\max}_{a} \\hat{q}(s_{t+1})$, that the value the network tries to converge to is allways changing, and if it varies to fast instabilities will arrise. One of the downsides of using gradient decent is that it can easily forget thing that it trained on a long time ago. The methods below attempts to minimize these issues.     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target network \n",
    "The idea here is to make $\\underbrace{\\max}_{a} \\hat{q}(s_{t+1})$ a slow varying target to increase stability. We introdue a second network called the target network. So we have two netorks $\\hat{q} = f(s)$ and $\\hat{q}_T = f_T(s)$, where the second is the target network. We use the second network to estimate the future estimated reward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$q(s_t, a) = r + \\gamma \\underbrace{\\max}_{a} \\hat{q}_T(s_{t+1}, a)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is then to update the target network slowly towards the first network, the weights of the target network $w_T$ can then be updated with \n",
    "\n",
    "$w_T = w_T + \\alpha_T (w - w_T)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_T$ is the target update rate. This adds stability to the traning as the future expected reward is more steady and slow changing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiance replay\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is experience replay, because of gradient descent we don't want to train on samples that are too close to each other as there is a risk that the network will forget things it has learned. The idea is then in the training loop to not directly train on the observed data but instead save it in a buffer/queue. For training we sample for the queue, this means that the network might train on old data or new data. This minimizes that it forgets or that a lot of samples in sequence are too similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch gradient decent \n",
    "\n",
    "To furter imporove stability we sample multiple timesteps from our memory buffer, then we caluclate the gradients for each of them and take the average of the gradients. It is then those average graidentes we use as $\\nabla_{w^i}$ to update the weights, this minimize noise as each update of the weights is based on multiple data samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now show how these things can be implemented in code. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyper parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can have quite a few hyper parameters and it can be quite tricky to tune them. I have provided some hypter parameters that work, but feel free to tune them if desiered.  "

    "\n",
    "The sharp increase in total reward around episode 400 suggests that the algorithm has started to learn effective policies from its interactions with the environment. This is likely due to the exploration phase, where the algorithm is trying out different actions and learning from the resulting rewards.\n",
    "The subsequent decrease and stabilization of the total reward around episode 600 could be a result of two factors:\n",
    "Exploitation: As the epsilon value decreases, the algorithm starts to exploit its learned knowledge more than exploring random actions. This could lead to a decrease in total reward if the environment is complex and the algorithm has not fully learned the optimal policy yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence: The algorithm might have learned an optimal (or near-optimal) policy for the environment, and is consistently applying this policy. This would result in a stable total reward over episodes. If the curve plateaus or flattens out, it suggests that the agent’s performance has stabilized and it has likely learned a policy that is close to optimal. This means the agent has found a strategy that works well and isn’t finding many new ways to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An upward trend in the curve indicates that the agent is learning and improving its performance over time. This is a good sign that the agent is effectively learning from its experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "High variance or lots of ups and downs in the curve can indicate that the learning process is unstable. This could be due to various factors, such as a high learning rate causing drastic updates, or the exploration rate leading to inconsistent behavior.\n",

    "Modifications: \n",
    "1)- Convolutional layers: n the modified code, you’ve added two convolutional layers at the beginning of the network. Each convolutional layer is followed by a ReLU activation function and a max pooling operation. Convolutional layers are particularly effective for image processing tasks because they can capture local features in the image, such as edges, corners, and textures. The max pooling operation reduces the spatial dimensions of the output, which helps to make the network invariant to small translations in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first convolutional layer has 32 filters nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=5, stride=1, padding=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second convolutional layer has 64 filters. nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=5, stride=1, padding=2) This layer can learn more complex patterns that consist of those basic features which habe been captured by the first layer\n",
    "\n",
    "2)- Max pooling: We added max pooling after each convolutional layer for the downsampling by a factor of 2 . It helps to make the network invariant to small translations in the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "3)- Flattening: The 2d feature map (output) is flattened into a one-dimensional vector before being passed to the fully connected layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "4)- Fully connected Layers: The structure of the fully connected layers remains the same, but the input size to the first fully connected layer has changed. In the original code, the input size was 28*28, corresponding to the size of the input images. In the modified code, the input size is 64*7*7, which corresponds to the output size of the last convolutional layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)-Forward Propagation: The forward propagation method has been updated to include the convolutional layers. The input is first passed through the convolutional layers, and the output is then flattened before being passed through the fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)- Changing the epsilon number from 500 to 1000 in your code would typically affect the exploration-exploitation trade-off if we are  implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm such as Q-learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "we decided to increase the number of episodes from 500 to 1000 in my reinforcement learning model. This means that the model gets to learn from more sequences of actions, which  lead to better performance since we did not achived the results untill we increased the episodes to 1000. The idea is that with more episodes, the model might discover more optimal actions or strategies.\n",
    "But there’s a trade-off. While more episodes could lead to better performance, it could also slow down the learning process. Why? Because the model needs to process more episodes, and that takes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)-The addition of convolutional layers and max pooling operations has likely improved the performance of the network on image classification tasks. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "2)-Convolutional layers learn hierarchical feature representations, which are highly effective for visual tasks. Deep networks with multiple layers of convolutions can learn features with increasing levels of abstraction, which helps in recognizing complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)-Max pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, making the network more computationally efficient and invariant to small translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)-By using these layers, the network has become more specialized in handling image data and can now learn more complex patterns with fewer parameters, leading to better performance.\n",
